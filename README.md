This is the repository from my course on how to build a fully functional Texas Hold 'Em game in Node.js.  To run a simulated 
game, just run the following command:

```
node game.js
```

```
# output

After the flop, George is winning with a pair
After the turn, Paul is winning with a pair
After the river, Ringo is winning with a two pair
